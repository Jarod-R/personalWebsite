        About Me
      </h1>
      
      <div className="space-y-6">
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I'm a scientist, entrepreneur, and investor currently based in Berkeley, CA. I work 
          at the intersection of aging biology, neuroscience, and frontier biotechnology. 
          After completing PhD and postdoc work, I left my Stanford fellows position to join 
          The Amaranth Foundation, where I am a group leader and the head of investments. 
          Along the way, I have founded 3 companies working in drug development, diagnostics, 
          and computer vision technology.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 pt-6">Values</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          My core values are agency, curiosity, and compassion. I beleive the most important
          axis of personal agency is health. Without it, your freedom is fundamentally constrained.
          That is why I want to create a world where everyone has complete agency over their health,
          which is only possible if we can stop and reverse the aging process.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Many academics, scientists, and other "elites" I meet object that curing aging will exacerbate 
          inequality, and is a vanity project for billionaires. I think they could not be more wrong.
          My family comes from humble roots in Tuba City, AZ, and Flint, MI, and I still have deep ties to these communities.
          I can tell you that the people in my community are rarely concerned about this, recognize
          it is a solvable problem, and understand intuitively that those around the world without 
          access to the best healthcare for graceful aging have much more to gain from new therapies for
          radically improved health. 
        </p>


        <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 pt-6">Adventures</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I have many passions and a fullhearted love for life. I have a particular love for the land of 
          the American Southwest, where I grew up in a small town near the Grand Canyon. Most of all, I love an adventure.
          Some of my recent wanderings include leading a 20 day whitewater rafting trip through the 
          Grand Canyon, walking ~1200 miles solo across the length of Japan, climbing The Nose on El Capitan
          in Yosemite Valley, and speed hiking the John Muir Trail over 7 days.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 pt-6">Music</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I am a classically trained violinist, and was the youngest ever professional member 
          of the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra. Nowadays, I am picking up the guitar, the handpan,
          and electronic music production. Check out some of my music here.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 pt-6">Vision</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I believe we're at a crucial moment in human history where advances in biology, computation, and medicine are converging to make meaningful interventions in aging possible. My goal is to accelerate this progress by connecting scientific insights with the resources and expertise needed to develop effective therapeutics.
