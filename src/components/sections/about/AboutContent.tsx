        About Me
      </h1>
      
      <div className="space-y-6">
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I'm a scientist, entrepreneur, and investor currently based in Berkeley, CA. I work 
          at the intersection of aging biology, neuroscience, and frontier biotechnology. 
          After completing PhD and postdoc work, I left my Stanford fellows position to join 
          The Amaranth Foundation, where I am a group leader and the head of investments. 
          Along the way, I have founded 3 companies working in drug development, diagnostics, 
          and computer vision technology, and provided consulting services to the biotech VC 
          industry in San Francisco.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 pt-6">Values</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          My core values are agency, curiosity, and compassion. I believe the most important axis of personal agency is health. Without health, your freedom is fundamentally constrained. Biological aging robs us collectively of more health than all other ailments and insults combined. Worldwide, aging is responsible for 50% of all deaths and reductions in quality of life.  To create a world where everyone has complete agency over their health and freedom to pursue their goals and passions, we must discover how to stop and reverse the aging process.        
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Some academics, scientists, and others I meet object that curing aging will exacerbate inequality or rob life of its fundamental meaning. I think they are wrong. My family comes from humble roots in Tuba City, AZ, and Flint, MI. Regular people have much more to gain from rapamycin and metformin than billionaires who already have access to perfect diets, stress-free lives, and elite healthcare. As to meaning, I get more of that from time with loved ones and my passions. Feel free to send me your best argument for why we need aging and death, and I will gladly debate you.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 pt-6">Adventures</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I have many passions and a fullhearted love for life. I have a particular love for the land of 
          the American Southwest, where I grew up in a small town near the Grand Canyon. Most of all, I love an adventure.
          Some of my recent wanderings include leading a 20 day whitewater rafting trip through the 
          Grand Canyon, walking ~1200 miles solo across the length of Japan, climbing The Nose on El Capitan
          in Yosemite Valley, and speed hiking the John Muir Trail over 7 days.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 pt-6">Music</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I am a classically trained violinist, and once upon a tiem was the youngest professional member 
          of multiple symphony orchestra in Arizona. Nowadays, I am picking up the guitar, the handpan,
          and electronic music production. Check out some of my music here.
